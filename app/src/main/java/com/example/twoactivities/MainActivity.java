    public static String message1 = "As a self-taught writer who has taken the long, winding road towards writing and literary efforts, I was slow to learn about writing long sentences, both how to do so and why one might want to do so, but finally was enlightened by three articulate authors and their books: Ursula LeGuin, the respected science fiction and fantasy writer, author of The Left Hand of Darkness, and the popular children’s series, Wizard of the Earthsea, encourages long sentences in her how-to book on writing, Steering the Craft, by quoting a 354-word sentence from Mark Twain’s Huckleberry Finn, which takes the long, slow route – LeGuin calls it the “marvelously supple connections of complex syntax” – to describing the details of a sunrise over the Mississippi River, including the sights, sounds, and smells of the unfolding morning; the second book which is less artistic, but perhaps more helpful to me personally was Ann Longknife, Ph.D and K.D. Sullivan’s book, The Art of Styling Sentences: 20 Patterns for Success – look for the second edition published in 2002 – which I studied with a writing friend, KN, and found to be extremely helpful in reviewing colons, semi-colons, appostives, etc, especially as KN and I posted to mutual mailing lists and encourage each other to use the patterns correctly and creatively and learned that control of language was essential to make the words mean what you want it to mean ( in fact, I found this book to be so useful, that I required it as a text when I taught Freshman Composition); and third, was Dona Hickey’s wondeful book, Developing a Written Voice, a virtual gem of a book – it’s not for the faint-hearted, because it reads like a college text book, but it’s a gem, nonetheless – which encourages the exploration of both long and short sentences, including sentence fragments, while Hickey also gives the writer a range of options for creating coherence and cohesion among the various parts of the sentence, including traditional rhetorical strategies such as schemes (unusual patterns of words) : schemes of balance, such as parallel structures, antithesis and the isocolon; schemes of unusual or inverted word order, such as anastrophe and parenthesis; schemes of omission, such as ellipsis, asyndeton or polysyndeton; schemes of repetition, such as alliteration, polyptoton, assonance, anaphora, epistrophe, epanalepsis, anadiplosis, tricolon, chiasmus, and of course, long lists – all useful tools to create long sentences and keep them understandable. Writing long is fun. Really. Try it.

    public static String message2 = "Sweat lies cold on Sandy’s skin. She shivers. Her stomach tightens and she tucks up her knees as pain slices through her gut. She grits her teeth and holds her breath. Then she exhales, slowly, controlling the flow of air to suppress the groan that’s fighting its way out of her throat. Her hands shake. Her forehead’s hot. A tingling between her shoulders creeps up the back of her neck and attacks her scalp with a thousand pinpricks. Beside her in the bed, George is sleeping. She can just make out the shape of his body and his arm, which is raised above his head. There is insufficient light to see his face but she knows his jaw will be slack, relaxed after all those beers. Just a few more Kingfishers, he had insisted, with Bill and Joanne, and Sohrab the tour guide, sitting around the crackling log fire under the stars, sharing good company and his best anecdotes as though nothing had happened.\n" + "‘Bastard,’ she whispers. ‘She was just a girl.’ She makes a fist, ready to punch him in the ribs, but her stomach grips again. She slips a leg out from under the covers, torn between an exhaustion that renders her too heavy to move and the knowledge that she really must get somewhere fast. She levers herself into a sitting position and her elbow catches the bottle of water on the bedside table. It lands with a thump and rolls, sloshing into the corner of the eco-cabin.‘Sandy?’ murmurs George, and he rolls over.Then another watery sound. Her stomach. The grip tightens. Suddenly she’s out of bed. Her fingers explore the table top, fumbling for her phone. In the faint screen light she fights her way out from under the mosquito net, retrieves the bottle of water, slips her feet into George’s trainers and stumbles outside into the night.As a self-taught writer who has taken the long, winding road towards writing and literary efforts, I was slow to learn about writing long sentences, both how to do so and why one might want to do so, but finally was enlightened by three articulate authors and their books: Ursula LeGuin, the respected science fiction and fantasy writerAs a self-taught writer who has taken the long, winding road towards writing and literary efforts, I was slow to learn about writing long sentences, both how to do so and why one might want to do so, but finally was enlightened by three articulate authors and their books: Ursula LeGuin, the respected science fiction and fantasy writerAs a self-taught writer who has taken the long, winding road towards writing and literary efforts, I was slow to learn about writing long sentences, both how to do so and why one might want to do so, but finally was enlightened by three articulate authors and their books: Ursula LeGuin, the respected science fiction and fantasy writer";

I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now. When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath of that universal love which bears and sustains us, as it floats around us in an eternity of bliss; and then, my friend, when darkness overspreads my eyes, and heaven and earth seem to dwell in my soul and absorb its power, like the form of a beloved mistress, then I often think with longing, Oh, would I could describe these conceptions, could impress upon paper all that is living so full and warm within me, that it might be the mirror of my soul, as my soul is the mirror of the infinite God! O my friend -- but it is too much for my strength -- I sink under the weight of the splendour of these visions!
